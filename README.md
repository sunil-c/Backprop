# Backprop

##Overview
This is a javascript implementation of a backpropogation neural network which uses a binary sigmoid (range 0,1) as the squash function. 
The data used to test the system is the well-known Iris data set. 

Development environment included Visual Studio Code, Google Web Server for Chrome, and Chrome web browser. Not necessary for running the 
application. 

The app has a single page, a single javascript file (main.js), and jquery. All the math and code is pretty much plain vanilla js.

Enjoy!
