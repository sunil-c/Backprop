# Backpropogation Neural Network

##Overview
This is a javascript implementation of a backpropogation neural network which uses a binary sigmoid (range 0,1) as the squash function.  The data used to test the system is the well-known Iris data set. 

Development environment included Visual Studio Code, Google Web Server for Chrome, and Chrome web browser. Not necessary for running the 
application. 

The app has a single page, a single javascript file (main.js), and jquery. All the math and code is pretty much plain vanilla js.

The app starts up, reads in the values from inputdata.js, targetdata.js, and eventually testdata.js. The full Iris data file in the  datastore_input.js, and corresponding targets are in datastore_target.js. Feel free to play around with the settings like the number of epochs, learning rate, etc.  All the settings are at the top of main.js.

Contact me if you have questions.

Enjoy!
