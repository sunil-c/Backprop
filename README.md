# Backpropagation Neural Network

## Overview
This is a javascript implementation of a backpropogation neural network which uses a binary sigmoid (range 0,1) as the squash function.  The data used to test the system is the well-known Iris data set. 
### Dev environment
Development environment included Visual Studio Code, Google Web Server for Chrome, and Chrome web browser. Not necessary for running the 
application. 
### App Description
The app has a single html page, no web service, an a single javascript file (main.js). It utilizes jquery although it would be pretty easy to remove that. All the math and code is plain vanilla js except for a few jquery calls.

The app starts up, immediately reads in the values from inputdata.js, targetdata.js, and testdata.js. The full Iris data file in the  datastore_input.js with corresponding targets are in datastore_target.js. 

You can play around with the settings like the number of epochs, learning rate, etc.  All the settings are at the top of main.js.

Enjoy!
